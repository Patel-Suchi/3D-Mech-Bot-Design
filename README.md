# 3D-Mech-Bot-Design

Designed and manipulated a complex multi-part model using geometric transformations, shape modelling and animation to bring the 3D Mech Bot design to life. Utilized Indexed Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) to perform efficient rendering of the model, including movements of the cannon and transformation of the robot. The result was a dynamic and visually stunning representation of the Mech Bot.
